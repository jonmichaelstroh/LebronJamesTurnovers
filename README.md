# LebronJamesTurnovers
An analysis of LBJ's turnovers as the season progresses based on an assertion by an NBA reporter that LBJ's turnovers decrease as we get into Jan, Feb, and then March.  Based on the data, there may be slight evidence that this is true.
Plus, a number of fun LBJ graphs for his 37th b-day!
